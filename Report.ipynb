Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image. Thus, objp is just a replicated array of coordinates, and objpoints will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image. imgpoints will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.\n",

    "I have tried both the convolution and sliding window methods to track the lane. And I found the convolution ones can't find the Dotted line in the threshold images. It is because of the layer, when the window height is not tall enough, the area may be totally black, so that the convolution operation could not find out the 'potential point'. But when we use the sliding window, it has a pre-sense of the lane by using polynomial, which is the mainly reason for me to choose the sliding window method.\n",
